# Android Technical Test

This is an indigitall Android Technical Test.

## Test

1. Resolve syntax errors
2. Get all Characters from [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters)
3. Parse data from JSON and show it in the app
4. Integrate [Firebase Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client) service and send a push notification with the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com)

### We will evaluate the following knowledge:

* Create a HTTP API Client 
* Parse JSON objects
* Integrate Firebase Messaging from Google

### Some issues

* We want to measure the quality of your code, not your speed 
* You are free to use the libraries that you want if you justify it
* You have TODO comments in the MainActivity to help you

### When you finish

* Add to this document your name and your email
* Add to this document your Firebase ServerKey (we can't evaluate Firebase integration without this)
* If you need comment or justify something write it in this document
* Zip your project folder, upload it to [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) and send it to sdk@indigitall.com
